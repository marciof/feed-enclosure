* TODO log to system when run by Liferea?

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.SysLogHandler
- need wrapper for Python? try/except?

* TODO tests

- linting (Python, shellcheck)
- automated
- CD/CI

* TODO license?

* TODO youtube-dl external downloader?

- calling youtube-dl directly creates as many instances as there are calls to it
  this can lead to degraded system performance, as well as download speed
  Liferea doesn't batch, so using eg. uGet would fix this
- missing metadata for IGN Daily Fix videos
- Liferea is still percent encoding some characters, "No%2C Kojima Isn't Making The PS5 Exclusive Abandoned - IGN Daily Fix.mp4"
- use UGet for better UI/GUI?
- user notification of download start and end?
