* TODO dependency updates

- notify Python package updates
- check if workarounds aren't needed anymore (add TODOs? report issues?)

* TODO tests

- linting (Python, shellcheck)
- type checking (Mypy)
- CD/CI

* TODO license?

* TODO youtube-dl external downloader

- how to resume or debug when only the video part has been downloaded?
  - resuming works fine, just missing some GUI notification?
  - need a better way to debug youtube-dl when merging?
  - show tray icon? with console output? potentially too many?
- switch to kGet?
  - hard to find documentation on uGet
  - it crashed once and lost all the settings and download history
  - not a lot of options for programmatic control?
- modify Liferea to have global option for auto-download, and filter cmd?
